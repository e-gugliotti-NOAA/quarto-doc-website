Welcome to the Stock Synthesis (SS3) Website!

## Introduction

Stock Synthesis (SS3) is an age- and size-structured stock assessment model in the class of models termed integrated analysis. Stock Synthesis has evolved over time to be able to model a wide range of fish population dynamics and body growth, and to utilize diverse types of data. The model is coded in C++ with parameter estimation enabled by automatic differentiation though AD Model Builder [ADMB](https://www.admb-project.org/).

SS3 is made up of:

-   A population sub-model that simulates a stock's:
    -   Biology (growth, maturity, fecundity),
    -   Recruitment,
    -   Movement, 
    -   Fishery selectivity
    -   Natural and fishing mortality, and
    -   Responsiveness to environmental and predation factors.
-   An observation sub-model that estimates expected values for various types of data,
-   A statistical sub-model characterizes the data's goodness of fit and obtains best-fitting parameters with associated variance, and
-   A forecast sub-model projects needed management quantities.

SS3 has a long history in support of stock assessments.  SS3 was developed by NOAA scientist Richard Methot in 1984 at San Diego, CA. This original application was for northern anchovy and the model was patterned after the concepts in Fournier & Archibald (1982). In 1989 a generalized version was developed for Pacific hake and sablefish along the U.S. west coast. This version, written in FORTRAN and using numerical derivatives, also began to be used in Alaska and Australia. In 2004, the model was translated into ADMB to take advantage of its analytical derivatives. Use of this version expanded further to ICES assessments and assessments for Atlantic and Pacific tunas and billfishes.  It also became a platform for instruction in stock assessment at the University of Washington, and it became prominent in the series of CAPAM workshops on good stock assessment practices.
There are 100+ stocks in the US and more throughout the world that use SS3. We and our colleagues have provided many national, international, and web-based trainings on SS3 for this community. Additionally, we have a very active user-base that contributes heavily to SS3 and the associated R packages as well as participating in the online discussions and forums.

## Getting Started with Stock Synthesis
To getting started with Stock Synthesis, please see the presentation below and the [Getting Started with Stock Synthesis Tutorial](qmds/getting_started_ss3.qmd):

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%", out.height= "400px"}

```

### Getting Started Using the Stock Assessment Continuum Tool
If you are just getting started with Stock Synthesis, we highly recommend downloading the [Stock Assessment Continuum Tool](https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool), a shiny app interface (pictured below) where users can provide data and life history information to create the Stock Synthesis input files, run the model, and produce plots and tables via the [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) package.

### Getting Started Using the Input Files
To learn more about how to build your own models in Stock Synthesis using the input files directly, see the [Develop a Stock Synthesis model](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/ss3-doc/ss3_model_tips.html) guide.

### Interacting with Stock Synthesis and Viewing Output Using {r4ss}
![](qmds/images/r4ss_logo.png){style="float: right;" fig-align="right" width="120" height="140"}

The [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) package is a collection of R functions for interacting with Stock Synthesis. These functions include downloading the executable, changing model input, running the model, and creating an assortment of model plots and tables. More information about using r4ss is available in the ["Introduction to r4ss"](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/articles/r4ss-intro-vignette.html) vignette as well as [example plots](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/BigSkate) created with {r4ss} (these plots were created usingthe Big Skate model found in the [ss3-test-models](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-test-models) repository).

### User Example Models
We maintain a GitHub repository of [example stock synthesis models](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-user-examples) for users. Information on what the key features of the user example models and how to download can be found [here](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-user-examples#readme).

## Asking questions about Stock Synthesis
Questions can be asked by opening an [issue](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/issues) or contributing to a [discussion](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/discussions) in the stock synthesis source code repository or by emailing nmfs.stock.synthesis@noaa.gov. You can also look for answers or submit questions to the [Stock Synthesis forums](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/public-forums). Note that an account is required to ask questions on the forums and that we are moving to GitHub for most of our communications, so we generally suggest starting with GitHub first.
